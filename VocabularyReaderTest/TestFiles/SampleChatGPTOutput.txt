Socratic Method:
[[[Socrates engaged in a method of questioning, known as the Socratic method, characterized by asking questions rather than explaining his own beliefs. The goal is to assist the person being questioned in discovering the truth on their own, promoting self-discovery and critical examination.]]]

Harm Principle:
[[[Socrates's harm principle consists of two claims: Firstly, no one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves, believing that all choices aim at some perceived good. Secondly, when a person does harm to others, they ultimately harm themselves by corrupting their own soul or character. Socrates argues that the greatest harm is a corrupted soul, and he emphasizes the importance of understanding the limits of one's knowledge to avoid causing harm.]]]

Ahimsa:
[[[Ahimsa is a concept in classical Indian philosophy, emphasizing the absence of causing injury or harm. It is a moral virtue found in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions, guiding individuals to avoid harm intentionally or unintentionally. Ahimsa extends to compassion and love for all beings, promoting positive actions and recognizing the interconnectedness of all existence.]]]

Oracle:
[[[In the context of Socrates, the Oracle refers to the Pythian prophetess at Delphi, a shrine dedicated to the god Apollo. Socrates consulted the Oracle to inquire about his wisdom and received a response that he was the wisest of men. The Oracle's enigmatic statements played a significant role in shaping Socrates's philosophical quest and his understanding of his own wisdom.]]]

Self-Examination:
[[[Self-examination is a key aspect of Socrates's philosophy, involving introspection and questioning one's own beliefs and knowledge. Socrates advocates the maxim "know thyself," encouraging individuals to investigate their thoughts, beliefs, and actions. Self-examination is essential for living an examined life, according to Socrates, and involves scrutinizing one's beliefs for consistency and justification.]]]
