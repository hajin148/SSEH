One obstacle that we as a team had to overcome is making a transition in technology partway through the prototyping phase. We had originally decided on creating an installable PC application in c++ via Qt Creator. We chose this because we had prior experience working on similar, team-based projects in Qt Creator. We later realized that our app would be much better suited as a web application, so we decided to switch technologies and create a ASP Core web application in C#. I believe that this was a good decision, as the ASP Core framework facilitates many aspects of creating web applications, such as creating a user account system and interfacing with a database.

An obstacle that I personally faced early on was determining how to read a PDF file and transform its contents into a string. This step was crucial to the usability of our product, as students would most likely have their electronic text files in a PDF format. I had to consider the types of things that could be present in a PDF file (images, formatting data, etc.) and investigate several different C# libraries. I eventually came to one that satisfactorily completed the task
